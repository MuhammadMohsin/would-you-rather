# Would You Rather

Would you Rather is interesting game where a user can answer a question in a poll  consisting of two options, and he have to pick only one of them. User do not have rights to withdraw/edit his answer of that question of a poll once he is done. The user can also add his own questions which other users can answer but he cannot. There is also a leaderboard page where the score is shown on the basis of how many questions a user have asked and answered.
